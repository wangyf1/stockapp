## Brief Introduction
This is a personal website of myself. It has a landing page, a resume page and a hobbies page. It also has a link to my Linkedin. It's built in HTML, CSS, JS and jQuery.

## Addressed Bullet Points
* One landing page: index.html contains introduction and navigation links.
* One navigational elements: a header bar. There is no dead end and user can choose where they want to go on every page. Header bar always appears when resizing.
* Two internal links: resume.html and hobbies.html. Internal links open their content in the same browser tab.
* One external link: Linkedin page. The external link opens new browser tabs.
* Two HTML tables: a experience table and an education table in resume.html. They are styled in css.
* Two interactive components. The tables' row in resume.html change color when mouse hovers. Used jQuery to implement.
* Responsiveness: Modified margin when screen width is below 600px in css.
